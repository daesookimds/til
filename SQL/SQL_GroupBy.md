## SQL GROUP BY Statement
### The SQL GROUP BY Statement
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

### GROUP BY Syntax

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

### SQL GROUP BY Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:

```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```

The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:

```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```


### GROUP BY With JOIN Example
The following SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:

```
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;
```
